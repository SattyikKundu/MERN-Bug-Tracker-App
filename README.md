# MERN-Bug-Tracker-App

This is a **Full-stack MERN portfolio project** that recreates the core
workflow of a project/issue tracking application similar to ***Jira***.
The app, named ***BugTrack Workspace***, allows registered users to
create projects, organize project members, create and assign issues,
move issues through a workflow board, hold threaded discussions, and
receive notifications about important project activity.

The application was built using the **MERN** (*MongoDB*, *Express*,
*React*, *Node*) stack, with additional emphasis on authentication,
role-based permissions, application state management, responsive UI
design, and a backend REST API that can be explored/tested using
***Swagger***.

**Read more to learn about the technology behind the app, its main
features, and how the application works through a typical
project-management workflow!**

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## I. Project Overview

-   **What is this app?**\
    It's a full-stack bug/issue tracking application where users can
    create project workspaces and collaborate with other registered
    users. Each project contains its own members and issues, whilst an
    Issue Board organizes those issues into a four-stage workflow from
    **Open** to **Closed**.

-   **What does it do?**\
    It lets users register/login, create and manage projects, add other
    registered users as project members, create and assign
    bugs/tasks/stories, move issues through workflow statuses, write
    threaded comments/replies, watch issue activity, and receive in-app
    notifications when relevant project activity occurs.

-   **Who is it for?**\
    Mainly development/project teams that need a centralized place to
    keep track of bugs, tasks, stories, assignments, discussions, and
    project progress. For this portfolio project, the application is
    designed as a smaller and more focused version of a professional
    issue-tracking platform.

## III. App Walkthrough & Screenshots

🔗 **Live Site:** [mern-bug-tracker-app.livedemoapp.com](https://mern-bug-tracker-app.livedemoapp.com/) *(Right-click to open in new tab for best experience)*

<ins>**NOTE**</ins>: The screenshots in this section are intentionally arranged in roughly the same order a normal user would encounter/use the application's pages and features.

### 1. Login and Account Registration Pages

The first page visitors normally see is the ***Login*** page. Existing users can enter their **username** and **password** to access theirBugTrack workspace. 
There's also a **Continue with Google** button for users who want to authenticate using their Google account instead of a locally stored BugTrack password.

Users who don't have an account yet can click the **Register** link near the bottom of the login card. After successfully logging in, protected
pages such as the Dashboard, Projects, Issue Board, Notifications, and Profile become available.
<img width="874" height="465" alt="1-Login-Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/088ee85b-7647-49de-b110-655dd672c78d" />

The ***Register*** page is where new users can create an account before accessing the protected workspace. Registration collects the account information needed by BugTrack, 
after which the user can return to the Login page and sign into the application.
<img width="874" height="465" alt="2-Registration-Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e4b7f245-c136-4b7c-b0d3-368bccfda5f9" />


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 2. Dashboard Page

After logging in, the user is taken to the ***Dashboard***. I designed this page to work as a quick "workspace overview" rather than forcing the user to immediately 
search through every project/issue.

At the top, the Dashboard gives the logged-in user a welcome message and summarizes the projects currently available to their account. It also shows up 
to **three recently updated active projects**, making it easier to jump back into work that was recently changed.
<img width="874" height="439" alt="3-Dashboard-Page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/253a8138-841b-4257-a707-070123dbdfa0" />


#### 2.1 My Work

Near the <ins>*bottom-left*</ins> of the Dashboard is the **My Work** widget (*see next image downwards*). This is a personal issue summary for the logged-in user rather than a summary for one specific project.

The counters show the user's total currently-active assigned issues separated into **Open**, **In Progress**, and **Ready for Review** statuses. Under the counters, 
BugTrack lists up to the **five most recently updated active issues assigned to the user**. Clicking one of these issues takes the user directly to that issue's details page.

#### 2.2 Recent Activity

On the <ins>*bottom-right*</ins> is the **Recent Activity** widget. Instead of creating a completely separate activity system just for the Dashboard, this widget reuses BugTrack's 
notification system and shows up to the **five latest notification items**.

This makes the Dashboard useful for quickly seeing recent assignments, project changes, comment activity, and other relevant updates. The **View All** link takes the user 
to the full Notifications inbox if they need to browse further back.
<img width="874" height="408" alt="4-My-Work-and-Recent-Activity" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f1505f62-898c-4395-8be5-e16360a470c7" />


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 3. Main Navigation Sidebar and Notification Header

After login, BugTrack's protected pages share a common header/sidebar layout. The left sidebar provides quick links to **Dashboard**, **Profile**, **Notifications**, 
**Your Projects**, and **Create Project**.

When a user opens a specific project, the sidebar also shows that project's own contextual navigation with **Overview** and **Issue Board** links (*see in left sidebar in bottom image*). This helps the user stay oriented inside the selected project without having to return to the main project list every time.

The **Notifications** sidebar link also displays the same unread-count badge used by the notification system, making unread activity visible even when the notification drawer is closed.
<img width="874" height="404" alt="5-Expanded-sidebar-with-selected-project" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/5f58acd5-1042-45d3-973f-1a589862e7ef" />

The top header also contains a notification bell. Clicking the bell opens a smaller notification drawer containing up to the **10 most recent notifications** for 
a quick activity check without leaving the current page (*Btw, below image only shows 2 since this is a test account*).
<img width="554" height="425" alt="6-Notification-Bell-and-opened-Notification-Drawer" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/570fdd5b-5acf-479a-900e-d8ea82d489cd" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 4. Your Projects Page

The ***Your Projects*** page is the main place for browsing all projects available to the logged-in account. Projects are separated into **Active** and **Archived** tabs, 
and each tab displays the number of projects inside it.

Users can also sort the project cards to make larger project collections easier to browse. Selecting a project card opens that project's Overview page, as shown below.<br> 
<img width="874" height="410" alt="7-Your-Projects-Active-Projects-tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6ca6fc82-0807-4afb-b3e4-538cb82458c3" />
<br><br>
Archived projects are intentionally kept in a separate tab rather than permanently disappearing. This allows project history to remain available even after active work on the project has ended. It's possible for an Archived project's lead to later "un-archive" a project and make it active again.<br>

<img width="874" height="380" alt="8-Your-Projects-Archived-Projects-tab" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/eaa78f28-3102-487f-997f-93e4e4fe0435" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 5. Create Project Page

A user can create a new project through the ***Create Project*** page. Each project requires a **Project Key** and **Project Name**, whilst a longer description is optional.

The Project Key is a globally unique **2-10 character** identifier that begins with a letter and is later used to create readable issue keys.
For example, a project with the key `BT` can create issues such as `BT-1`, `BT-2`, etc.

Once the project is successfully created, the creator becomes the project's initial **Project Lead** and member, 
and BugTrack automatically takes the user to the new project's Overview page.<br>
<img width="874" alt="9-Create-Project-form" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8d49afaf-5684-42d6-9260-53a92be53a1a" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 6. Project Overview & Project Management

Opening a project takes the user to its ***Overview*** page. This is where users can view the project's name, description, project lead, and member list. 
From here, the **Overview / Issue Board** navigation can be used to switch between project administration/details and the actual issue workflow (*see entire example image below*).<br>

<img width="874" alt="10-Project-Overview-page-Example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2daefef-fe38-4884-a653-00de9c7f9b40" />


#### 6.1 Project Members and User Search

Project leads (and users with the appropriate administrative permissions) can manage the project's member list. Instead of manually entering MongoDB IDs, 
the **Add Members** section lets the project manager search BugTrack's registered users by information such as name, username, or email and add matching users directly to the project. You have to type *at least* 2 characters to get any returns of existing users from the database.

Existing members are visibly marked in the search results so they aren't accidentally added twice. Project members can also be removed, although BugTrack prevents actions 
that would violate the project's leadership/member rules.<br>
<img width="874" alt="11-Add-Members-Users-Search-Results" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6e1f8fd-16dc-4863-87b5-0683e3065190" />

#### 6.2 Project Leadership

Every project has a single **Project Lead**. The lead receives additional project-management permissions, but leadership isn't permanently tied to the person 
who originally created the project.

If a project contains multiple members, leadership can be transferred to another **existing project member**. The current lead cannot simply remove themselves first; 
leadership must be transferred so the project <ins>never</ins> ends up without a valid lead.<br>
<img width="874" alt="12-Transfer-Leadership-section" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4b18ba27-90e4-42a6-aef3-1b89ba2eb518" />


#### 6.3 Project Archive / Restore

When active work is finished, the Project Lead can **Archive** the project instead of deleting all of its history. Archived projects keep their members, issues, comments, 
and existing activity, but become **read-only**.

This means users can still revisit an old project's information without accidentally modifying it. The project can later be restored from the Archived projects list 
if work needs to continue.<br>
<img width="874" alt="13-Archived-Project-Section" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/65e0cb68-4e82-426d-8cf7-e08e1dd27d15" />


For an additional administrative safeguard, permanent project deletion is reserved for the application's global administrator role rather than being 
the normal way project leads finish a project.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 7. Project Issue Board

The ***Issue Board*** is one of the app's main features. Each project's issues are divided into four workflow columns:

1.  **Open**
2.  **In Progress**
3.  **Ready for Review**
4.  **Closed**

This gives the user a visual overview of where each bug, task, or story currently sits in the project's workflow.<br>
<img width="1300" alt="14-Four-Column-Issues-Board-page" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/bac24e34-4985-4c0b-91df-d5a50a04aac7" />


#### 7.1 Issue Board Search & Filters

As a project's issue count grows, users can narrow down the board without repeatedly requesting a new issue collection from the server.

The board includes a search field that can match issue **keys**, **titles**, and **labels**, together with quick filters for **Priority**, **Issue Type**, and **Assignee**. 
For assignment filtering, users can quickly switch to issues assigned to themselves or currently unassigned issues. Btw, it's possible that no issue cards can show up if any of the issue cards in the project's issue board does not match the filter combination (*like in the image below*).<br>
<img width="1300" alt="15-Issue-Board-with-Search-and-Filters-applied" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/13d1861b-b5b8-4c66-85f9-6ac74c17fec1" />

#### 7.2 Drag-and-Drop Workflow

Issue cards can be moved through the workflow using **drag-and-drop**. The app uses `dnd-kit` package to support mouse, pen, and touch interactions whilst 
still keeping explicit workflow controls available (*each issue card also has clickable buttons that moves the issue card to left or right*).

Not every column is a valid destination from every status. BugTrack checks the requested workflow transition on the client for faster feedback and then checks 
it again on the backend before saving the change.

For a *smoother UI*, valid-looking drag operations are displayed optimistically. If the backend rejects a move---for example, because the card is being dragged into an invalid column---the issue is restored to its original status and visually returns to its original column. Below is an example of an issue card being "grabbed" and dragged.<br>
<img width="1000"  alt="16-Issue-Board-whilst-dragging-an-Issue-Card" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/beae58e6-710d-4ec2-9a13-f1fdc2449af0" />


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 8. Creating an Issue

Project members can create new issues from *inside* a selected project's Issue Board via clicking the **Create Issue** button near the top-right corner(*see earlier Project Issue Board for visual reference*). BugTrack supports three issue types: **Bug**, **Task**, and **Story**.

The issue form stores the main information needed to track the work, including the issue's **title**, **description**, **type**, **priority**, **severity**, **assignee**, 
and **labels**. The user who creates the issue becomes its reporter, whilst assignment determines which project member is currently responsible for the work.

Each issue also receives a human-readable key based on its parent project's key---for example `BT-12`. Below is an example of a blank issue form that a user could fill out for a project.<br>
<img width="900" alt="17-Create-Issue-Form" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/610a5ece-eab8-415e-bc5e-f9a97cb70a24" />

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 9. Issue Details Page

Clicking an issue card---or one of the assigned issues in **My Work**---opens the ***Issue Details*** page. This page is intended to be the main place for 
reading and discussing one specific issue.

The page shows the issue's title/key, description, status, type, priority, severity, reporter, assignee, labels, and other issue information. 
Users with the required permissions can also access the Edit Issue form (*below is a complete example of a fully detailed issue page for an issue card*).<br>
<img width="1000" alt="18-Issue-Details-page-example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/9a8e6276-cd2c-4c81-a7d8-e4dae132acb4" />

#### 9.1 Issue Status History

Whenever an issue moves between workflow statuses, BugTrack records the transition in its **Status History**. This makes it possible to see how the issue progressed through 
the workflow (*this refers to the different issue stage columns inside the current project's Issue Board*) rather than only seeing its current status.<br>
<img width="1101" alt="19-Issue-Status-History" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/defa9bfb-48c0-4d47-933d-4fb0abe52d42" />

#### 9.2 Watching an Issue

Issues can also have **watchers**. Watching an issue <ins>allows</ins> a user to follow important activities associated with that issue through the notification system.

BugTrack also automatically connects certain users to issue activity where appropriate—*for example*, the issue reporter and initial assignee are included 
when the issue is created, and a newly assigned user can be added when assignment changes. The **Watch**/**Unwatch** button is on the top-right of the Issue Details page as shown below.<br>
<img width="999" alt="20-Issue-Details-Watch-Unwatch-Control" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/32c4620e-0b14-4e5b-9969-d5392603d3fc" />


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 10. Editing an Existing Issue

The same general issue form is reused when editing an existing issue, but the available changes depend on the logged-in user's permissions and project state.

This is important because **NOT** every project member should be able to modify every piece of issue data. For example, only project leadership/administrative permissions 
are used for assignment-related management, whilst the backend remains the final authority for whether an update is allowed.

Archived projects also prevent issue modifications because their existing data is intentionally read-only.<br>
<img width="1100" alt="21-Edit-Issue-form-example" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d81d94a-1a33-4c21-9005-a5bbdc8f4ec6" />


------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 11. Issue Comments and Threaded Replies

At the bottom of the Issue Details page is the ***Activity*** section. Project members can use this area to post comments such as implementation notes, questions, 
testing results, or general updates related to the issue.<br>
<img width="900" alt="22-Issue-Activity-Comments-section" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a2deaa6d-36b3-4da9-bda8-bd95453c58b3" />

The comment system also supports **nested replies**. A user can reply directly to a specific comment, and the UI visually indents nested replies so it's easier to follow which message belongs to which part of the conversation.

For larger discussions, users don't have to render every reply at once. Individual branches can be opened with **Show replies**, additional replies can be loaded, 
and an **Expand thread** option can recursively open the conversation below a selected comment. Expanded branches can also be collapsed again. Below is an example of a ***MASSIVE*** comment thread for an issue and it even has clear indication on which comment replies to what.<br>

Users can **Edit** their own comments, whilst deletion follows the app's permission rules. When a comment with existing replies is deleted, the conversation underneath isn't destroyed; 
the deleted comment remains as a placeholder so its replies stay connected to the thread.<br>

<br><br>
Finally, open comment discussions refresh automatically about every **30 seconds** while the browser tab is visible. This gives the issue discussion a lightweight collaborative 
feel without requiring WebSockets or a dedicated real-time chat system.

### 12. Notifications Inbox

As users work across projects, BugTrack generates in-app notifications for relevant activity such as issue assignments, issue status changes, comment replies, project membership changes, project leadership changes, and watched-issue activity.

The full ***Notifications*** page acts as the user's activity inbox. Notifications can be filtered between **All** and **Unread**, individual notifications can be deleted, 
and the **Mark all as read** button clears the current unread state.<br>
<img width="1100" alt="25-Notifications-Inbox-and-Pagination" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/2f1c517c-fbd5-4408-aca0-551f4b61f322" />
<br><br>
A full inbox uses pagination with up to **20 notifications per page**. Pagination controls allow the user to move between the first, previous, numbered, next, and last pages 
without loading the entire notification history into the interface at once.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### 13. Profile & Account Settings Page

The ***Profile*** page is where the logged-in user can manage their own account information. Users can see their profile field values as well as update those same profile fields, such as their **first name**, **last name**, **username**, and **email**.

Users with a locally stored BugTrack password can also change their password through the **Password** section. Google-authenticated accounts are handled appropriately 
when no local BugTrack password is stored.<br>

#### 13.1 Notification Preferences

The bottom portion of the Profile page contains the user's **Notification Preferences**. Rather than forcing every notification category on every user, 
BugTrack allows individual categories to be enabled/disabled.

Current preference categories include:
-   Issue assignments
-   Issue status changes
-   Comment replies
-   Project membership changes
-   Project leadership changes
-   Watched issue activity

This lets each user decide which types of project activity are important enough to appear in their own notification inbox.

## IV. Current App Limitations

<details>
<summary>
<strong>App Limitations (Click to Expand):</strong>
</summary>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
This project is intentionally a smaller, portfolio-sized interpretation of an issue tracker rather than a complete replacement for a large platform such as <strong>Jira</strong>. Features such as organizations, multiple project-role tiers, sprints, epics, advanced reporting, file-storage infrastructure, and enterprise integrations are outside the current scope.
</li>
<li>
The application currently uses lightweight <strong>30-second polling</strong> for visible comment/notification updates rather than WebSockets. This keeps the architecture simpler for the current project whilst still allowing open pages to periodically receive updated activity.
</li>
<li>
Archived projects are intentionally read-only. Users can continue viewing their existing issues/comments/history, but project modifications require the Project Lead to restore the project first.
</li>
<li>
The current notification system is <strong>in-app only</strong>. Email, SMS, push notifications, and external messaging integrations are not part of the current version.
</li>
<li>
The project currently focuses on the MERN application itself. The larger DevOps portion of the portfolio project—including automated testing, CI/CD, containerization, and cloud deployment—is planned as part of a later development phase.
</li>
</ul>
</details>

## V. Steps to Use App Locally

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Steps to Setup App Locally (Click to Expand):</strong>
</summary>
<br>
<ol>
<li>
<strong><ins>Ensure these pre-requisites are installed/setup first</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<strong>Node.js</strong> and <strong>npm</strong>.
</li>
<li>
A running <strong>MongoDB</strong> database (local MongoDB or a compatible hosted MongoDB connection).
</li>
<li>
<ins>Optional</ins>: Have an active GitHub account if you want to fork/clone the project through Git.
</li>
<li>
<ins>Optional</ins>: Use an IDE such as <strong>Visual Studio Code</strong> for editing/running the client and server code.
</li>
<li>
<ins>Optional</ins>: A Google Cloud OAuth application if you want to test the <strong>Continue with Google</strong> registration and login flow.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Clone (or download) the repository locally</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
<ins>Run the Git clone command</ins>:<pre><code>git clone [YOUR FINAL GITHUB REPOSITORY URL]</code></pre>
</li>
<li>
<ins>Change into the project folder</ins>:<pre><code>cd Bug-Tracker-App-with-DevOps</code></pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Install packages for both the Client and Server</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Both <code>/client</code> and <code>/server</code> contain their own <code>package.json</code> files.
</li>
<li>
<ins>Install the client packages</ins>: 
<pre>
<code>
cd ../client 
npm install
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li><ins>Then install the server packages</ins>:
<pre>
<code>
cd ../server
npm install
</code>
</pre>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Setup the environment-variable files</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The React client uses <code>VITE_API_URL</code> to identify the backend API URL.
</li>
<li>
The Express server currently reads configuration values including:
<ul>
<li>
<code>PORT</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>MONGO_URI</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>MONGO_DB_NAME</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>CLIENT_HOME_URL</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>JWT_SECRET</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>SESSION_SECRET</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>GOOGLE_CLIENT_ID</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>GOOGLE_CLIENT_SECRET</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>GOOGLE_CALLBACK_URL</code>
</li>
<li>
<code>NODE_ENV</code>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Do NOT commit real secrets/credentials to GitHub.</strong> Keep private values inside local environment files and provide safe example values separately if an <code>.env.example</code> file is added.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Ensure the client/server URLs match your local setup</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
The current Vite development configuration uses port <code>3000</code> for the frontend.
</li>
<li>
The Express server uses <code>PORT</code> from the environment, with <code>5000</code> as its fallback.
</li>
<li>
The server's <code>CLIENT_HOME_URL</code> must match the frontend origin so credentialed CORS requests can be accepted.
</li>
<li>
The client's <code>VITE_API_URL</code> must point to the running Express backend.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Run the app locally</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Open two terminals (or two terminal tabs inside VS Code).
</li>
<li>
<ins>Terminal 1 --- React client</ins>:
<pre>
<code>
cd client
npm start
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li><ins>Terminal 2 — Express server</ins>:
<pre>
<code>
cd server
npm run dev
</code>
</pre>
</li>
<li>Once both are running, the frontend should open in the browser and communicate with the Express/MongoDB backend.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<strong><ins>Optional: Explore/test the backend API with Swagger</ins>:</strong>
<ul>
<li>
Whilst the Express server is running, Swagger UI is mounted at <code>/api-docs</code> on the backend server.
</li>
<li>
This provides a convenient way to inspect many of the REST endpoints and manually test backend behavior during development.
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ol>

## VI. Features / DevOps Work to be Added Later

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Future Features/DevOps List (Click to Expand):</strong>
</summary>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
Add automated end-to-end browser testing using <strong>Selenium</strong> to test important user workflows such as login, project creation, issue creation, workflow movement, and comments.
</li>
<li>
Add a <strong>Jenkins</strong> CI/CD pipeline so automated checks/build steps can run when application changes are prepared for deployment.
</li>
<li>
Containerize the client/server application using <strong>Docker</strong> so the development/deployment environment can be reproduced more consistently.
</li>
<li>
Move the production MongoDB database to <strong>MongoDB Atlas</strong>.
</li>
<li>
Deploy the application to <strong>AWS</strong>, beginning with a straightforward deployment approach and later considering services such as ECR/ECS as the project's DevOps architecture grows.
</li>
<li>
Potentially expand the issue-tracking feature set later with more advanced project-management concepts if they add meaningful portfolio value without turning this smaller Jira-inspired application into an unnecessarily large clone.
</li>
</ul>
</details>

## VII. Additional Development Notes

<details>
<summary>
<strong>Backend/API & Application Architecture Notes (Click to Expand):</strong>
</summary>
<br>
<ul>
<li>
The frontend and backend are separated into their own <code>/client</code> and <code>/server</code> folders, with separate dependency lists and development commands.
</li>
<li>
Protected frontend routes rely on the authenticated user state, whilst protected backend endpoints verify the user's JWT and apply additional project/issue permission middleware where needed.
</li>
<li>
The backend separates major features into models, controllers, routes, middleware, and utility modules for areas such as authentication, projects, issues, comments, user search, and notifications.
</li>
<li>
Redux Toolkit is divided into feature slices for authentication, projects, issues, comments, and notifications so frequently shared application data can be managed centrally.
</li>
<li>
Project and issue permissions are enforced on the backend even when the React UI also hides/disables actions. The client-side permission checks are mainly for user experience; the backend remains the final authorization layer.
</li>
<li>
Swagger/OpenAPI documentation is included so backend endpoints can be reviewed/tested independently from the React interface during development.
</li>
</ul>
</details>
